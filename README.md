# React Slider #

This project demonstrates how to use React components to create a slider that defines a range. The background of the slider is a 
gradient which shows the active range in darkening shades of red. Items outside the range are shown in black (below lower limit) and blue (above upper limit).

NOTE: On Firefox, the edges of the thumbs do not always correspond
to the edges of the gradient, but the CSS is arranged so that this
is not readily obvious.

See src/Slider.jsx for more details.
